# uCount

uCount is a simple and reliable polling system designed with schools in mind. The purpose of uCount is to provide a quick and easy way for students to vote on certain matters at school, such as voting for their favorite club, their favorite talent in a talent show, or a new class President. uCount was written in Java Enterprise Edition by myself and my friend, Kevin Thorne. It was used during an assembly at Bingham High School and worked very well despite hundreds of students connecting to the application within a few minutes via the web browsers on their phones.
